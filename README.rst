Sudoku Maker is a generator for Sudoku number puzzles. It uses a genetic
algorithm internally, so it can serve as an introduction to genetic
algorithms. The generated Sudokus are usually very hard to solve |--| good
for getting rid of a Sudoku addiction (or maybe not).

It also includes a simple depth-first solver for sudoku puzzles |--| the
solver is internally needed when generating sudoku puzzles. The included
``sudoku.py`` can be called and reads a sudoku from standard input.
It outputs the solution (if any) or if there isn't a single solution to
the given puzzle it will output several (up to a maximum).

The representation of sudoku puzzles is a simple: 9 lines with 9 numbers
in each line, e.g., ::

    010070800
    000008000
    706000003
    000009120
    000006050
    003004007
    090010002
    200000400
    000450900

The numbers 1-9 represent the given numbers of the puzzle while the
zeros represent the empty tiles. A solved puzzle simply contains no
zeros. I've adopted the file extension ``.sud`` for this format.
The puzzle in the example was created by ``sudokumaker`` with the option
``-r 1`` which sets the random seed to 1, so the puzzle should be
reproduceable with this option (on a 64bit architecture).
The example above when rendered with ``sudoku_as_tex`` and
compiled with LaTeX will look something like the following:

.. image:: r1.png

There are some variants of sudoku puzzles supported. The first variant
adds the diagonals (so in each of the two diagonals the numbers 1-9 must
be present), this variant can be requested with the ``--diagonal``
option. A printed example (which was again generated with the random seed
1 but now with the ``--diagonal`` option) looks as follows:

.. image:: diag-r1.png

For the diagonal variant I've adopted the extension ``.sudd`` |--| note
that the normal sudoku and the diagonal-constrained sudokus are not
compatible, if interpreted as a normal sudoku, a diagonal-constrained
sudoku would have multiple solutions.

The second variant requires that in each quadrant there are 9 distinct
colors, the same color is always at the same position in each quadrant.
The numbers 1-9 must be present on each of the colors.
For this variant I've adopted the extension ``.sudc``, as with
diagonal-constrained sudokus, color-constrained sudokus would have
multiple solutions if interpreted as a normal sudoku.  This variant can
be requested with the ``--colorconstrained`` option. An example looks as
follows:

.. image:: color-r1.png

Sudoku puzzles can be pretty-printed as LaTeX using the included
``sudoku_as_tex`` program. This currently supports printing the
diagonals in yellow if the ``--diagonal`` option is given.
Color-constrained sudokus can be printed with the ``--colorconstrained``
option. The following color map applies:

============ ======
color        letter
============ ======
red          r
pink         p
violet       v
grey         g
orange       o
yellow       y
light green  l
dark green   d
blue         b
============ ======

If these letters are used in the color constrained sudoku, the table
above applies. Other letters can be used, too, but the color assignment
for printing will be arbitrary in that case.

A third variant, sometimes called *kikagaku* has irregular colored
shapes *instead* of the 3X3 blocks. These can currently only be printed
using the ``--kikagaku`` option to ``sudoku_as_tex`` but *not* be
generated using ``sudokumaker``. The format I'm using for these is a
modification of the ``.sud`` format. It contains the numbers in the same
format as in ``.sud`` followed by lines with letters where each letter
represents a unique color. Of course each letter has to appear exactly 9
times.  I've not included a puzzle because I currently cannot generated
them automatically. An empty puzzle in that format would look as follows::

    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    rrrrvvvvg
    brbrrvggg
    brbrovvvg
    bbbbovggg
    blooooogp
    llldopppp
    ldddoypyp
    llldyypyp
    lddddyyyy

The same color map as for color-constrained sudoku puzzle applies.
This would be rendered as follows:

.. image:: kik.png

For the genetic algorithm library, my python wrapper *pgapy* of the
parallel genetic algorithm library (pgapack) is needed. There is
currently no Windows support for *pgapy* but recent changes to *may* be
a step in the right direction: PGAPack is now bundled with *pgapy*.
For a skilled person it should be possible to
get PGAPack running on Windows, so if you're doing this, let me know.

Version 1.0: Mark as stable, Python3

Now marked as Development Status Production/Stable

- Python3
- Stable
- Remove SF logo
- Documentation update, pictures
- Add rendered examples

Version 0.4: Packaging fixes

Fix package name again, stick to sudokumaker to avoid name collisions.

- Package namespace is now sudokumaker again
- Sudokumaker depends on rsclib.sourceforge.net

Version 0.3: Color, Diagonal

Now color constrained and diagonality constrained sudokus are supported.

- Diagonality constrained sudokus must have the digits 1-9 in the
  diagonals, too. When printing, diagonals are printed in yellow.
- Color constrained sudokus have 9 additional colors which are in the
  same position in every quadrant. These must have the digits 1-9, too.
  When printing we chose 9 different light colors.

Version 0.2: README update

The README (and the SF homepage which is generated from it) had wrong
link to the project. Also the python package index didn't accept one of
my classifier. Grmpf.

- Fix project link in README (SF Logo)
- Remove one classifier not accepted by pypi

Version 0.1: Initial Release

Sudoku Maker is a generator for Sudoku number puzzles. It uses a genetic
algorithm internally.

- First Release after a long silent development
